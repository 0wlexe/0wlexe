I'm a cybersecurity student, and this is a place for me to keep my programming studies and personal projects. 

 I'm currently working on the <img src="https://github.com/j4nedoe/python-automation">automation of networking processes</a> with Python, and plan on update some <img src="https://github.com/j4nedoe/shell-script">Bash</a> scripts.
