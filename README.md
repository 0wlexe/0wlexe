# Hi, there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

I work with cybersecurity, and this is a place for me to keep some of my programming studies and personal projects. 

 I have some [automation of networking processes](https://github.com/j4nedoe/python-automation) with Python, and plan to update some [Bash](https://github.com/j4nedoe/shell-script) scripts in the future.
